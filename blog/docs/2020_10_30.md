# Yielding Generators

![Generators]({{ static_assets }}/images/generator.jpg)

In our [previous](https://blog.michaelgreen.dev/posts/2020_10_23/) blog post, we spent some time discussing the iterator protocol and how we can build custom objects which hook into the `for` loop syntax of the Python programming language. Today, we're going to continue discussing iterators by looking into a specific sub-class of these objects, called *generators*. We'll see how generators provide us convenience and flexibility when it comes to hooking into the iterator protocol.

## Generators: `__next__()` vs `yield`

Like iterators, generators use the iterator protocol for iteratively yielding method and function results. The difference between the two objects however is in their construction. Instead of creating a `__next__()` method in a class, we only need to call `yield` in place of a typical `return` call so to create a generator. This simplified syntax allows us to apply the iterator protocol to both class methods and functions with a high degree of flexibility.

As a simple example, let's go ahead and look at the `CountByTwos` object we created last week and refactor it into a generator. To recap, our `CountByTwos` object hooked into the iterator protocol by instantiating the methods `__iter__()` and `___next__()`.

```python
class CountByTwos:
   def __init__(self, start, stop):
      self.internal_value = start
      self.stop = stop

   def __iter__(self):
      return self

   def __next__(self):
      snapshot = self.internal_value
      if snapshot >= self.stop:
            raise StopIteration
      self.internal_value += 2
      return snapshot
```

```python
In [1]: [x for x in CountByTwos(start=4, stop=24)]
Out[1]: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]
```

With generators, we hook into this same protocol. However, the methods `__iter__()` and `___next__()` instead map to the generator's instantiation and the keyword `yield`. So as a generator function, we can refactor `CountByTwos` to the following.

```python
def count_by_twos(start, stop):
   internal_value = start
   while True:
      yield internal_value
      internal_value += 2
      if internal_value >= stop:
            return StopIteration
```

```python
In [2]: [x for x in count_by_twos(start=4, stop=24)]
Out[2]: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]
```
As we can see, the generator function and the Iterator class object contain many of the same ideas. They're both instantiated, they both can be called via `next(obj)`/`obj.__next__()`, and they both iteratively return results to the user until a `StopIteration` is encountered.

```python
In [3]: a, b = (
   CountByTwos(start=4,stop=8), 
   count_by_twos(start=4,stop=8)
)

In [4]: next(a), next(b)
Out[4]: (4, 4)

In [5]: a.__next__(), b.__next__()
Out[5]: (6, 6)

In [6]: next(a)
Out[6]: StopIteration                             
Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-28-15841f3f11d4> in <module>
----> 1 next(a)

D:\Programming\ZZ_Sandbox\file_iterator.py in __next__(self)
      146         snapshot = self.internal_value
      147         if snapshot >= self.stop:
--> 148             raise StopIteration
      149         self.internal_value += 2
      150         return snapshot

StopIteration:

In [7]: next(b)
Out[7]: StopIteration                             
Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-29-adb3e17b0219> in <module>
----> 1 next(b)

StopIteration:
```

With generators, the `StopIteration` can be passed implicitly by finishing all `yield` statements. Once the generator executes all it's containing yield statements, a subsequent `next()` call will return the `StopIteration` and either error out or exit the `for` loop protocol.

```python
def count_by_twos(start, stop):
   internal_value = start
   while internal_value < stop:
      yield internal_value
      internal_value += 2
```
```python
In [8]: [x for x in count_by_twos(start=4, stop=24)]
Out[8]: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]
```

## Example: CSV concatenation (part 2)

As a core library developer, I'm always looking for ease-of-use optimizations that allow the tools I develop to be used as seamlessly as possible. From last week's blog, we created a set of objects that would allow a user to concatenate a set of CSV files into a single CSV file. The protocol for using these objects looked like the following, where we successively called each iterator within nested for loops so to write the CSV contents line-by-line to the resulting file.

```python
with open(r'D:\Programming\ZZ_Sandbox\file_iterator\test.txt', 'w') as f:
   for file in FileManager.from_directory(
      r'D:\Programming\ZZ_Sandbox\file_iterator', '.csv'
   ):
      for row in file:
            f.write(row)
```

Now, the result here is perfectly functional. However, from a user experience perspective, the interface is rather clunky. Having to interact with two objects here in this explicit manner so to accomplish a single task in my opinion is undesirable. We can make use of the more flexible generator paradigm so to wrap the functionality of the `FileIterator` into a class method of the File Manager.

```python
import glob
import os.path


class CSVcat:
   def __init__(self, files: list) -> None:
      self.files = files
      with open(self.files[0]) as f:
            self.headers = f.readline()
      self.file_generator = self._file_generator()

   def __iter__(self):
      return self

   def __next__(self):
      return next(self.file_generator)

   def _file_generator(self) -> str:
      yield self.headers
      for file in self.files:
            f = open(file)
            next(f)
            for row in f:
               yield row

   @staticmethod
   def from_directory(file_dir: str, ext: str) -> 'CSVcat':
      return CSVcat(glob.glob(os.path.join(file_dir, "**"+ext)))
```

With this new object, we've wrapped the functionality of the FileIterator into a generator method. We're using the `__init__()` method of this new `CSVcat` object to instantiate the generator method within the class instance, as well as extract the header information from one of the files. `CSVcat.__next__()` calls the generator's `__next__()` method, which iteratively calls the generator as `CSVcat` is iterated over. With the added flexibility provided by the `yield` keyword, we can fluently handle yielding the `self.headers` row, as well yielding only the data rows as the list of files is iterated over. The result of this is that we can execute the entire protocol in a single for loop.

```python
with open(r'D:\Programming\ZZ_Sandbox\file_iterator\test.txt', 'w') as f:
   for row in CSVcat.from_directory(r'D:\Programming\ZZ_Sandbox\file_iterator', '.csv'):
      f.write(row)
```

## Summary


The iterator protocol is a powerful tool that Python developers can leverage for efficient data processing. Both iterators and generators provide us with a set of unique means for customizing our solutions. Here, we've used both models to hook into the `for` loop syntax of Python, allowing us to fluently process a high volume of data without having to worry about memory overload.
