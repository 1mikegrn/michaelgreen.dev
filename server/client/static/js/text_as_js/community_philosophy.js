As members of a community, I wholeheartedly believe that it is our responsibility to be active proponents for education at all stages of individual development. This is why for the first three years of my PhD work, I worked with the School of Medicine to teach the chemistry portions of their diversity outreach programs. It was an amazing opportunity to work with these middle and high school level kids who were so passionate about taking every opportunity to grow. Working with these students, showing them the chemistry of the life inside us and the world around us, was a pleasure and an honor.
