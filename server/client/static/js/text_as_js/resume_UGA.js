Studied the properties of volatile elements that were the result of nuclear fission. Research focused on the physical adsorption of volatile radionuclei onto various materials synthesized in lab, such as hollow carbon nano-polyhedrons and metal-organic frameworks. Work involved theoretical studies of molecular compounds, synthesis of compounds, analysis (GC/MS, BET, XRD, Raman, UV-Vis, et alia), the engineering and construction of testing apparatuses and miscellaneous devices for general laboratory use, and composition of written material for publication. Research was conducted in conjuncture with the US Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory.
