Developed micro- and nanoscale materials for application in clean energy systems, photocatalysis, water photolysis, physical adsorption, and microwave absorption. Dissertation research focused on understanding and utilizing the bulk dielectric and magnetic field properties of materials so to induce interaction with GHz-range electromagnetic radiation. Utilized and established a wide variety of synthesis methodologies to generate materials such as pure and perturbated -oxides (Titanium, Aluminum, Silicon, Zirconium, et alia), -sulfides (Copper, Copper-Iron, Cobalt, et alia), -phosphides (Iron, Cobalt), conductive polymers, graphitic carbon nitrides, polyoxometalates, and metal-organic frameworks, through fabrication processes such as solvothermal/hydrothermal methods and PECVD. Developed expertise in a broad array of instrumentation techniques, such as Complex Permittivity and Permeability Network Analysis, Polarized Light Microscopy, UV-Vis Spectroscopy, Raman Vibrational Spectroscopy, SEM/EDX, TEM, XPS, XRD, BET, FTIR, EPR, NMR/SSNMR, PALS, et alia, for materials characterization and analysis. Developed computational programs which utilized data-driven methods so to to accurately analyze, simulate, and predict materials performance. Built the libRL library, which is an open-source Python library used for state-of-the-art microwave absorption characterization through numerical methods and machine learning. Also built the CompGen library, which is a Python library that uses personally-developed materials models to accurately predict multi-system composite performance. Established laboratory protocols for the treatment and disposal of hazardous chemical waste in accordance with EH&S, EPA, and the State of Missouri guidelines. Research supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant 1609061, and affiliated/collaborated with The Environmental Protection Agency, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, et alia.
