Prepared and presented in-depth chemistry material for undergraduate collegiate studies, and supervised in-lab experimental procedures. Participated in experimental preparation, which included the maintenance of legacy laboratory equipment such as GC, distillation, UV-Vis, Bomb Calorimeter, Oscilloscope, and FTIR equipment. Worked with students to update laboratory procedures, including but not limited to writing software to automate experimental analysis and revamping experimental procedures. Frequently interacted with students via small group and one-on-one tutoring on a weekly basis. Oversaw the fair, responsible grading for submitted laboratory coursework.
