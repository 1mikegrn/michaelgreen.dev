I believe that potential is infinite. When it comes to my students, it doesn't matter where they come from, what class they were born into, what privilege they have or they lack. The goal is growth, plain and simple. As a teacher, it's my job to be sure that not only are my students proficient in the material they are tasked to cover, but that they strive for the greatest of growth which they can manage. 
<br><br>
When it comes to manifesting growth in the classroom, I like to draw on my experience both as a student of chemistry as well as a student of computer science. One of the core tenants of the Python programming language is that 'explicit is better than implicit.' And, some of the best chemistry professors who I have studied under, such as Dr. Eric Brauns at the University of Idaho and Dr. Charles Wurrey at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, have all managed to adhere to this ideal in their teaching. I aspire to do the same. To me, this means not leaving room for guesswork in lecture material. A fully contextual, depth-first approach to content. If necessary to choose, I would rather teach students how truth is derived, not what truth is. Only one of these models scales beyond the classroom, and our job as educators is to prepare students for life beyond university education.
<br><br>
Throughout my experience as an educator, I’ve found that different students resonate to different modes of engagement, and discovering those most-efficient modes is an ever-evolving process. Not only are students tasked with learning from the material I teach, but I am in turn tasked to learn from my students; through observing how they collectively respond to the material in real-time, and tuning the lecture performance towards that to which the audience best resonates. In this way teaching is more of an art than a science. From my experience as a student, the best teachers have always been able to convey their content at a level beyond mere information transfer. It is through being mindful of this duality that such is possible.
<br><br>
While it seems fairly obvious, I find it important to remember that every student is fundamentally an individual. Certain teaching styles may resonate better with some as compared to others. Though try as we might to be as thorough as possible in our teaching, sometimes students get tripped up and miss a step. Given this truism, it’s important that every student feels as if they are always welcome to approach me away from the lecture hall so to ask for further clarification. I’ve always maintained an open-door policy past normal office hours, and I consistently encourage students to seek my individual council should their understanding of the material wander astray.
<br><br>
So, in terms of a teaching philosophy, here's my aim: provide explicit standards and guidance as to how they can achieve growth which scales; recognize that different audiences require different styles and methods of engagement to achieve high-yield; be available to work with students at an individual level; and tailor the education experience to meet students where they are at, in a manner which inspires the greatest growth.
